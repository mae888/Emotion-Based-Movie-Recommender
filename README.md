# Emotion-Based-Movie-Recommender
Python script that recommends movies to the users based on the dominant emotion displayed by them


This Python script takes advantage of pre-built libraries to create a movie recommendation system based on the user's current emotions. By utilizing the OpenCV library for webcam image capture, DeepFace for emotion recognition, and PyMovieDb for accessing popular movies from the IMDb database, the script provides a straightforward way to suggest movies tailored to optimize the user's mood. The user's dominant emotion, determined through their webcam, is mapped to a corresponding movie genre, from which a movie title is selected and recommended. This project is an easy-to-use tool for generating personalized movie suggestions based on the user's emotional state.
